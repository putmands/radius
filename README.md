Replication code for "Social Network Structure and the Radius of Risk Sharing" accepted at _Social Network Analysis and Mining_. 

**Data**
The paper draws on two empirical illustrations, in Colombia and Tanzania. The Colombia illustration draws on data from Attanasio et al. (2012) and de Weerdt (2025). To replicate this project, download this data from the repositories cited below.

**Software**
The results were produced using R and Stata. For R, I include a set-up script that will install necessary packages. For Stata, the user will need to install NGREG, written by Marcel Fafchamps, to obtain regressions with dyadic robust standard errors.
